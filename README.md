✔️ What is Reactjs ?  </br>
React is an external library that helps us create websites easier. </br>

✔️ What is JSX ? </br> </br>
Javascript XML Is a syntax extension for javascript that allows developers to write HTML -like markup directly within  their Javascript code. </br>
JSX looks very similar to HTML but it is not (becus it has different syntax). </br>

NOTE: JSX is more strict than  normal HTML.  All elements need a closing tag.  </br>
E.g  </br>
<input placeholder="Send a message to Chatbot" size="30"></input>  </br>
But if you not goona put anything inside or nothing inside our element , you can use a “self closing tag” like this <input /> </br>


✔️ What is Babel ?  </br>
Babel is known as a “Javascript compiler”. It basically translate other languages into javascript. </br>
Why do we need Babel: </br>
When using “React”, we actually don’t use normal javascript, we use an “enhanced version of javascript” called JSX.  </br>
JSX stands for “Javascript  XML”. Is the same as javascript but we can also write HTML directly in our javascript code.	</br>
